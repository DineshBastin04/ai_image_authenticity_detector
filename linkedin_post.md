# 🚀 Just Built: AI Image Authenticity Detector (Open Source)

Excited to share a project I've been working on: an AI-powered tool to detect whether an image is Real or AI-Generated! 🕵️‍♂️✨

**The Tech Stack:**
*   🐍 **Backend**: FastAPI & PyTorch (Vision Transformers)
*   ⚛️ **Web**: React & Vite
*   📱 **Mobile**: Flutter
*   🔍 **Model**: Fine-tuned Vision Transformer (`prithivMLmods/Deep-Fake-Detector-v2`)

**Challenges & Learnings:**
Getting the right model to run efficiently on a standard CPU was a fun challenge. I'm currently using a Vision Transformer (ViT) that achieves **partial detection success** on local hardware. 

While it's not catching 100% of the latest Flux/Midjourney v6 generations (yet!), it's a solid proof of concept. To achieve full state-of-the-art accuracy, we'd likely need to scale up to larger models running on dedicated GPUs. 

But for a lightweight, open-source tool running locally? It's pretty cool to see the "heatmaps" light up on suspicious regions! 🔥
